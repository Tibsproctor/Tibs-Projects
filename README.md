# Data
The recorded data of crimes in Los Angeles provides detailed information about the type, location, and timing of incidents, aiding law enforcement and policymakers in crime analysis and prevention efforts. 
This data is essential for understanding crime trends, allocating resources effectively, and developing strategies to enhance public safety.

# What is my goal with this data?
The goal with the crime_data dataset is to investigate potential correlations and patterns between various factors related to crime occurrences. 
Specifically, the aim is to analyze how the location and time of crime incidents relate to each other and potentially influence the frequency or nature of criminal activities. 
This analysis seeks to uncover insights that could aid in understanding crime dynamics within the dataset, identifying trends or hotspots in criminal 
activity, and informing strategies for crime prevention and law enforcement resource allocation.

# Hypthosis
The hypothesis posits that there exists a correlation between the location and time of criminal incidents and the frequency or occurrence of crime. 
This implies that certain areas or times may be more prone to criminal activity compared to others. The investigation aims to test this hypothesis by analyzing the crime_data dataset to 
uncover potential patterns or relationships between the spatial and temporal aspects of crime occurrences.

# null hypothesis
The null hypothesis is that there's no significant connection between where and when crimes happen.
